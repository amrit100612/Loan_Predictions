# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

A Machine Learning–powered system that predicts whether a loan application will be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant financial and demographic information.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment using an interactive web application.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a robust **classification model** that predicts loan approval status using applicant-level financial and demographic attributes, helping financial institutions automate and improve decision-making.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Total Records:** 614
* **Input Features:** 13
* **Target Variable:** `Loan_Status`

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values
* Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
* Feature scaling (if required)
* Outlier detection & treatment

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution plots
* Correlation heatmap
* Loan approval trends
* Credit history impact analysis
* Class imbalance detection
* SMOTE for balancing dataset

---

### 3️⃣ Model Building

The following classification models were implemented:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report
* Cross-validation

---

## 📈 Best Performing Model

🏆 **Random Forest Classifier**

After hyperparameter tuning, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy and balanced precision-recall performance, making it the final selected model.
